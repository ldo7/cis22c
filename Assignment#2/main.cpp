 Assignment #2
 
 This program saves students' information at a school. The user will be
 prompted to enter the number of students, each student’s name, how many
 tests the student has taken, and the grade for each test. Once each
 student’s information has been entered, the program will display the
 number of students. Additionally, each student will have their name,
 list of test scores displayed.
