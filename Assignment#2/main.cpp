 Assignment #2
 
 This program saves students' information at a school. The user will be
 prompted to enter the number of students, each studentâ€™s name, how many
 tests the student has taken, and the grade for each test. Once each
 studentâ€™s information has been entered, the program will display the
 number of students. Additionally, each student will have their name,
 list of test scores displayed.
